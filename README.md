# Conway's Game of Life

A brute force implementation in C++

## What's this?

Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game defined by a state of cells either dead or alive. The evolution of the state is governed by fixed rules. More information [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

## How to Execute

Download the GameOfLifeLinux.cpp or GameOfLifeWin.cpp file from the repository as per your operating system, compile and run! I compiled and tested using `g++ -std=c++17` on Ubuntu and MinGW on Windows.

Note: In case of the error "'std::this_thread' has not been declared" on Windows machines, use MinGW with POSIX Threads.
